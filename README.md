# ðŸ“† ToDoList-C#
This is a project made in C# which is similar to a to-do type application, but with various functionalities.

# ðŸª„ Functionalities
1. To make the application look better I used Google's Material Design skin for you windows forms app.
2. We have created a menu where the user can navigate between:
	- Profile (The user's data are taken from the file, but he has a button that by accessing it will open a new form where he can enter his new data, which will be stored in the file)
	- All (In this window, with the help of a ListView, the user can see all his tasks, but he can also filter them according to category. It also has a calendar, a button through which a new form is opened and he can introduce a new task. At the same time, I added some questions that later help them generate graphs, such as: "Tasks completed today", "How do you feel today?" file and there is a validation that one day there will be only one answer to these)
	- Pending (The user can view uncompleted tasks)
	- Complete (The user can view completed tasks)
	- Charts (Here you can view a graph, each column means the average of this year's answers. He can save his tasks in binary format, but also take them from it. Also here there is a button that generates a document with all complete tasks)
	- Manage Category (The user can see the existing categories for tasks, but can also enter one)
	- Settings (The user can set dark or light mode, language and theme color)
